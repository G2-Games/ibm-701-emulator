## Speedcoding Interpreter
[Speedcoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcoding), also known as Speedcode and SpeedCo I, is a programming language created by John Backus for the [IBM 701 Electronic Data Processing Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_701) in 1953. This project is partially an attempt to recreate an interpreter for Speedcoding on "original" hardware.
